Testing Coverage: (In progress)

# IMS-Starter

This app creates an inventory management system (or inventory system) which would allow a business to track goods throughout the entire supply chain, from purchasing to sales. the creation of an order is the equivalent to the creation of a shopping cart. Then it's functionality allows to add items to existing orders. The CRUD functionality  that governs the controllers of the application allows for Just reading,updating and deleting fields from a MYSQL Data Base.

MySQL (Instalation Process) :

Maven (Instalation process) :

## Running the tests

If you have any IDE installed such as Eclipse you can click on a project and run "Coverage As" allowing JUnit to make results available in the code coverage results view.

### Unit Tests 

This trail is about unit testing in Java. The app uses JUnit, a Regression Testing Framework used to implement unit testing in Java, and accelerate programming speed and increase the quality of code. JUnit tests the smaller units of the application, like classes and methods. ... These Unit tests are typically automated, meaning once they are implemented, they can be run again and again.
